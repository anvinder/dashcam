After using the dashcam for a week here are some observations and things that need to be worked on :

Observations:
- The video is rotated 90 degree but i fixed it from vlc player : Tools > Effects and Filters > Video Effects> Geometry. 
- other issue is that the RTC clock for some reason was not working and the date and time was always 1/1/2020. using the link in the rtc file it has been fixed and tested. 
      Will deploy this solution and check the outcome after a couple of days. 
- Another issue is to connect the raspberry pi zero sd card to the computer to pull the videos. had to amke cahnges to the physical case of the pi so
      that the sd card can be taken out. 
      There could be other solutions but at this point i'll remove the sd card to read the videos. 
- One challenge is to read the raspian/ linux files on windows, for this there is a windows app named "Diskinternals Linux Reader". I used this to 
      read the linux videos of dashcam on windows laptop. 



Open challenges still:
- One last observation is that the video from the dashcam appears to be running very fast. As if it is being played at 2x. The vlc player shows it is 
      1x infact so need to figure out why does the video play fast. No jsut the car but the still people in sorroundings seem to be moving very fast.
